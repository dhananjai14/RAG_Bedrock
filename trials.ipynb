An enhanced\\nreconstruction method is proposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In the traditional SVD re-\\nconstruction method, the faulty data may a ﬀect other fault free data. The enhanced SVD (ESVD) reconstruction\\nmethod is a robust method to map as a normal data. The statistical hypothesis test, namely GeneralizedLikelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is applied to detect the fault in the residual space. The proposed method perfor-\\nmance is veri ﬁed by the real data of Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR).\\n1. Introduction\\nContinuous sensor health condition monitoring provides a variety of\\nbeneﬁts such as improved reliability, improved safety, reduced un-\\nnecessary periodical sensor calibration testing. For monitoring and\\ncontrolling application of a complex production system, a large number\\nof distributed sensors are used to provide chronological and spatial\\ninformation. However, along with the bene ﬁt of using distributed\\nsensors, there are some risks because of the severe consequences mayarise, if the signals provided by sensors are out of calibration. A faulty\\nsensor can provide an inappropriate information that can a ﬀect the\\nsystem supervision and decisions making. Therefore, continuous mon-itoring of the performance of the sensor, i.e., sensor fault detection and\\nlocalization are important issues in current research work.\\nIn the literature, sensor fault detection and isolation are broadly\\nclassiﬁed into two categories: model-based method and data-driven\\nmethod. In the model-based method, a mathematical model is designedbased on the physical representation of the process variables. They\\ninclude Kalman ﬁlter ( Hajiyev and Caliskan, 2000; Salahshoor et al.,\\n2008; Saravanakumar et al., 2014), parity equation ( Gertler, 1997;\\nOdendaal and Jones, 2014 ), Luenberger observer-based ( Tarantino\\net al., 2000; Alkaya and Eker, 2014) and state observer-based approach\\n(Zarei and Poshtan, 2011). The application of model-based depends\\nupon the availability of the model because, in a complex system, it isvery di ﬃcult to get an exact mathematical model. Another approach for\\nfault detection is the data-driven method. This is based on historicaldata, not necessarily the good knowledge about the physical re-\\npresentation of the process parameters. In general, data-driven methodsare identi ﬁed the faulty sensor using classi ﬁcation and data redundancy\\ntechniques. In classi ﬁcation technique, the faulty data are segregated\\nfrom the normal data. Several classi ﬁcation methods are applied in\\nfault detection; these include Support Vector Machine (SVM) ( Banerjee\\nand Das, 2012; Yin et al., 2014; Namdari and Jazayeri-Rad, 2014 ),\\nNeural Network ( Fast and Palme, 2010; Palmé et al., 2011 ) and Deep\\nLearning ( Tamilselvan and Wang, 2013; Shang et al., 2014). The clas-\\nsiﬁcation methods are detected faulty data, not the faulty sensor and\\nthe classi ﬁcation accuracy depends on the complexity of the data, i.e.,\\nheterogeneity, non-linearity and dimensionality of the data. Therefore,data reconstruction methods are practical for fault detection in in-\\ndustrial application. Data redundancy may produce two ways, one is\\ndata approximation and another is data reconstruction. The data are\\napproximated by di ﬀerent types of arti ﬁcial neural network (ANN)\\nlearning techniques, like Back-propagation Neural Network (BPN) ( Wu\\nand Saif, 2005), Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN) ( Huang,\\n2004 ), Cascade Neural Network (CNN) ( Hussain et al., 2015 ), and Re-\\ncurrent Neural Network (RNN) ( Talebi et al., 2009). These methods are\\ncomputationally complex and have some parameters. This is di ﬃcult to\\nupdate the model, because, in many industrial applications of conditionmonitoring such as Nuclear Power Plants, it is common to update the\\nmodel periodically in order to follow gradual medication of signal\\ncharacteristic. On the other hand, data reconstruction models are less\\ncomputation complexity. For data reconstruction, several statisticaltechniques\\nare employed, they are Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\\n(Harkat et al., 2006; Tharrault et al., 2008; Harrou et al., 2013 ), Auto-\\nAssociative Kernel Regression (AAKR) ( Garvey et al., 2007; Maio et al.,\\n2013 ), and Partial Least Square (PLS) ( Muradore and Fiorini, 2012).\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nucengdes.2017.08.028\\nReceived 19 October 2016; Received in revised form 21 August 2017; Accepted 23 August 2017⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: shyamapadamandal@sastra.ac.in (S.

Baraldi et al. (2015) noticed that the reconstructed signal by\\nAAKR is a ﬀected by drift trend, they assume the values in the middle of\\ndrifted and expected values. In PCA reconstruction, the reconstructed\\ndata are not mapped to normal data, because selected principal com-\\nponents are unable to capture the important features of the data. Re-\\ncently, Harrou et al. (2013) noticed that the PCA reconstruction model\\nwith the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) fault detectionperformance is desirable. The reconstruction error is adjusted by the\\nGLRT. The PCA-GLRT is superior to PCA-T\\n2-statistic and PCA-Q-statistic\\n(Harrou et al., 2013). But, the accuracy depends on the choice of\\nprincipal components, and heterogeneity, non-linearity, and di-\\nmensionality of the data. To overcome these di ﬃculties, an alternative\\ndata reconstruction method, namely singular value decomposition(SVD) was proposed ( Mandal et al., 2017b). Jha and Yadav (2011) were\\nnoticed that SVD based reconstruction is an e ﬀective tool for denoising\\nthe signal. But in faulty data reconstruction, the few faulty points of a\\nsensor may a ﬀect the whole data points of that signal, which may\\nproduce false alarms.

Brief description of FBTR\\nThe FBTR uses plutonium-uranium mixed carbide as fuel and liquid\\nsodium as a coolant. The entire system is broadly divided into three\\nsystems: primary sodium system, secondary sodium system, and steam\\nand water circuit. The important components of the primary sodium\\nsystem are the reactor assembly, two intermediate heat exchangers\\n(IHX), two sodium pumps and interconnecting piping. The secondary\\nsystem includes sodium pumps, re-heaters, surge tanks, steam generator\\nand connecting piping. The heat generated in the fuel sub-assemblies\\nare removed by circulating liquid sodium through the reactor core. Two\\ncentrifugal pumps are used to pump sodium through the fuel sub-as-\\nsemblies in the reactor core. Three thermocouples are used to measure\\nthe sodium temperature at the inlet of the reactor core. The central fuel\\nsub-assembly contains four thermocouples (Tna000X, Tna000Y,\\nTna000Z, and Tna000W) at the outlet and the rest of each 84 fuel sub-\\nassemblies contain two thermocouples (Tna0nX, Tna0nY, for n = 01 to\\n84) at the outlet. Chromel-Alumel type thermocouples are used to\\nmeasure the temperature of sodium at the inlet of the reactor core and\\nat the outlet of the fuel sub-assemblies. The schematic diagram of the\\nFBTR is depicted in Fig. 1.\\nIn this work, thermocouple sensor fault detection is proposed using\\nstatistical methods. The proposed method is based on data re-\\nconstruction. The next section explains the data reconstruction tech-\\nnique using principal component analysis and singular value decom-\\nposition.3. Proposed method\\nThe SVD is an e ﬀective tool for denoising in image processing,\\nsignal processing, and statistical analysis. It is used to map the data into\\nthe normal data by removing noise and outlier by reconstruction\\ntechnique ( Mandal et al., 2017b ). The proposed fault detection tech-\\nnique is based on a data reconstruction technique. The ESVD based datareconstruction method is applied. The fault detection process consists of\\ntwo steps: (i) residual generation, and (ii) residual evaluation. Residual\\nis generated by reconstructing the data using the ESVD method. The\\ndeviation of reconstructed data from the original is called residual. The\\nresidual space is tested by the GLRT to detect the faulty sensor. The\\nblock diagram of the proposed method is given in Fig. 2. The re-\\nconstruction of the proposed method is compared with PCA and SVD.The idea of the ESVD reconstruction method is same as the PCA re-\\nconstruction method. The next subsection explains the data re-\\nconstruction by the PCA, SDV, ESVD, and the statistical hypothesis test\\nGLRT for fault detection.\\n3.1. Data reconstruction using PCA\\nThe PCA is a widely used statistical tool for dimension reduction\\nand data reconstruction. PCA is used to project the data into a lower\\ndimensional linear space such that the variance of the projected data is\\nmaximized. Equivalently, it is the linear projection that minimizes the\\naverage projected cost, i.e. mean squared distance between the data\\npoints and their projections. Let\\nXbe a data matrix with dimension\\n×MN, whereMis the number of observations and Nis the number of\\nvariables. The data samples are considered as→……→xx,M1 in a N-dimen-\\nsional space, where the mean is computed as→=∑→\\n=μxMiM\\ni1\\n1along with\\ntheir covariance =∑→−→→−→\\n=C xμxμ() ()MiM\\niiT 1\\n1. The eigenvalues and ei-\\ngenvectors are computed from the covariance matrix Cby eigenvalue\\ndecomposition or SVD. The SVD is computed the eigenvalues and ei-genvectors as:\\n=CUVΣT (1)\\nwhere UandVare the ortho-normal and Σis the diagonal matrix of\\neigenvalues in descending order i.e. >> … >λλλ NN 11 22 . The matrix C\\nis a symmetric matrix, so the eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors\\nare orthogonal. Also, by construction, the matrix Cis positive semi-\\ndeﬁnite so, λNN≥0, i.e. eigenvalues are nonnegative.\\nThus, for the problem at hand to use a PCA approach is to represent\\nthe data Xin a di ﬀerent space (p dimensional, p < N) using a set of\\nprincipal orthogonal vectors→viofVcorresponding to largest eigenva-\\nlues. PCA reduces the dimension by projecting the data onto a spacespanned by the eigenvectors→viwith>λTii , whereTis a threshold. In\\nother words, the dimension reduction is achieved by ordering the ei-genvalues from highest to lowest, to get the components in order of\\nsigniﬁcance. Thus, projecting\\npeigenvectors that corresponding to\\nhighestpeigenvalues, the reduced matrix is de ﬁned as:\\n̂=SXV (2)\\nwhere=… ∈×Sss s[,,. ,] pMp12 R is called the score vector or principal\\ncomponent vector and ̂=… ∈×Vvv v[,,,] pNp12 R is called the loading\\nvector, are the eigenvectors corresponding to plargest eigenvalues.\\nThus, one needs to obtain the eigenvalues >> … >λλλ NN 11 22 and\\nplot=∑∑==fpλ λ() /ip\\niiN\\ni 11, to see how fp()increases with pand takes\\nthe maximum value of iat=pN. PCA is good if f(p) asymptotes rapidly\\nto 1. This happens, if the ﬁrst eigenvalue is big and the remainder are\\nsmall. PCA is bad if all the eigenvalues are roughly equal.\\nThe data reconstruction can be done by:\\n̂ ̂=XX V VT(3)\\nTherefore, the data matrix Xcan be written as:\\n̂ ̂ ̂ ̂ =+= + −XX EX V V X V V I()TT(4)S.

The largest eigen-\\nvectors are selected by scree-plot, sequential analysis, parallel analysis,\\ncumulative percent variance.\\n3.2. Traditional singular value decomposition for data reconstruction\\nThe SVD method factorizes the given matrix into singular value and\\nsingular vector matrices. The details of the SVD method are provided in\\nMandal et al. (2017b) . Any matrix, ∈×XRmn, where >mn,can be\\ndecomposed as:\\n=XU VΣT (5)\\nwhere Uis an×mmleft singular vector, Vis an×nn right singular\\nvector and Σis an×mn diagonal matrix with singular values in des-\\ncending order i.e. >> … >λλλ nn 11 22 . The left and right singular vec-\\ntors are the eigenvectors of XXTandXXTrespectively, and the singular\\nvalues are the eigenvalues of XXTorXXT. The singular vectors are\\northo-normal, i.e. = UUITmand=VVITn, where Iis the identity\\nmatrix. If the Σis written as:\\n=⎡\\n⎣⎢\\n⎢⋯\\n⋮⋱⋮⎤\\n⎦⎥\\n⎥=⎡\\n⎣⎢\\n⎢⋯\\n⋮⋱ ⋮\\n⋯⎤\\n⎦⎥\\n⎥+…+⎡\\n⎣⎢\\n⎢⋯\\n⋮⋱ ⋮\\n⋯⎤\\n⎦⎥\\n⎥λ\\nλλ\\nλΣ0\\n000\\n0000\\n0nn nn11 11\\n(6)\\nthen the Eq. (5)can be re-written as,\\n∑=\\n=Xuλ v\\nin\\nii iniT\\n1m\\n(7)\\nBy Eq. (6), the data can be reconstructed by selecting the importantsingular values. The SVD approach operates by projecting the original\\ndata onto a new basis, which captured the principal features of the data.\\nIf the number of principal singular value k is determined, the dimension\\nof the singular vectors and singular value matrices are truncated into k\\ndimension as, ∈∈××UVRR, kmkkmkand∈×RΣkkk.\\nThe data can be reconstructed by the multiplication of the truncated\\nmatrices:\\n=××XU V Σkk kT(8)\\nResidual is generated by the di ﬀerence between the original data Xand\\nreconstructed data X.\\n=−EX X| (9)\\nThe goodness of the SVD reconstruction depends on an accurate\\nselection of principal singular values. Over and underestimation of the\\nnumber of singular values can initiate noise that disguises the important\\nfeatures in the data and omit important variations in the data which is\\ndegraded the reconstruction by SVD. So, it is important to choose the\\nappropriate principal singular values. Like PCA, important singular\\nvalues can be selected by the Cumulative Percent Variance ( Diana and\\nTommasi, 2002 ), parallel analysis, sequential tests ( Jolliﬀe, 2002 ), etc.\\nIn this paper, principal singular values are selected by the cumulative\\npercent variance that captured over 90% of the cumulative sum of the\\neigenvalues. In general, the ﬁrst singular value is always captured\\nabove 90% variance of the data. Therefore, unlike PCA, the principalcomponent selection in SVD is the easiest problem.\\n3.3. Enhanced SVD method for data reconstruction\\nIn the traditional SVD method, the training data are taken at normal\\ncondition of the plant with all sensors are in healthy condition. The\\nFig. 1.

(1). The\\nprincipal component is selected based on the dominated singular va-\\nlues. In sensor data, the ﬁrst singular value is always larger, i.e., cap-\\ntured above 90% variation of the data. The dimension of the left sin-\\ngular vector, right singular value and singular value matrices are\\ntruncated based on the number of principal singular values. The\\ntraining data matrix is reconstructed by multiplying these truncated\\nmatrices in a given order. For test data reconstruction, similarly, the\\ndata matrix decomposes into three matrices and their dimensions\\ntruncated into lower dimension based on the number of principal sin-\\ngular values as chosen in the training phase. For fault free test data, the\\nreconstruction is mapped to normal data as training reconstruction.\\nBut, if the test data have any faulty sensor, the few faulty data points\\nwill aﬀect all the data points of that sensor in reconstruction. The af-\\nfectation may increase or decrease the value. It has created a problem toﬁnd out the exact location of the faulty region of the sensor data. As a\\nresult, it may produce false alarms. To come out from this problem, thispaper proposed an enhanced technique for test data reconstruction. The\\nprinciple of enhanced SVD (ESVD) reconstruction is based on PCA data\\nreconstruction technique. Since the right singular vector matrix is\\northo-normal, i.e.\\n=V IVTn. Therefore, the test data can be re-\\nconstructed as follows:\\n=××YYV VkkT(10)\\nwhere Yis the test data matrix of dimension l×n ,Yis the re-\\nconstructed test data matrix of dimension l× n and V kis the principal\\nright singular vector matrix of the training data of dimension n×k .\\nThe ESVD data reconstruction is robust because it is using the principal\\nsingular vectors of the normal data (training data), the reconstruction\\nmatrix is not a ﬀected by the faulty data points.\\n3.4. Generalized likelihood ratio test\\nBinary hypothesis tests are applied for fault detection. The idea\\nbehind the binary hypothesis test is to make a yes or no decision aboutthe existence of a fault. The details of this subsection are provided in\\n(Harrou et al., 2013; Mandal et al., 2017a ). Let\\nXbe the observation\\nvector with distribution function Px()θ,θis the parameter belongs to\\nparameter space Θ. Two types of hypothesis are used in fault detection,\\nthe null hypothesis =Hθ θ:0 0, that represents no fault and the alter-\\nnative hypothesis =Hθ θ:1 1, that represents the existence of a fault.\\nTherefore, in fault detection, the parameter space is assumed as:\\n=⋃θΘ{ }θ\\n01, where⋂=∅θθ\\n01. The composite hypothesis is also applied\\nto classify the di ﬀerent types of fault with di ﬀerent magnitude\\n=θi n, 1,2,... i For composite hypothesis, the parameter space is de ﬁned\\nas:=⋃ … ⋃θΘ{ .}θ\\nnθ\\n01 . The test is used to mapping the observation space\\nonto a set of hypothesis as: /DoubleCapR→δH H:{ , }n01. The e ﬃciency of the test\\ncan be measured by two functions, the probability of false alarm and\\nthe power function. The false alarm deﬁ nes false rejection of the nullhypothesis H0, and power function de ﬁnes the probability of deciding\\nH1whenH1is true. For an e ﬀective test probability of false alarm will\\nbe less and power function will be high.\\nAmong the di ﬀerent binary hypothesis tests for fault detection, the\\neﬃcient statistic is uniformly most powerful (UMP) test. The UMP test\\ndeﬁned the test with the greatest power among all possible tests for a\\ngiven probability of false alarm ( Borovkov, 1998). However, the UMP\\ndoes not exist in all cases, because, the distribution function should be amonotone likelihood ratio and the test should be one sided.\\nThe GLRT is an alternative to UMP test, which can solve a composite\\nstatistical hypothesis problem by maximizing the likelihood ratio\\nfunction. Let\\n/DoubleCapR∈xn, be an observation vector, for fault free case which\\ncan be generated as a Gaussian distribution σI(0,)n2N and for faulty\\ncase generated by Gaussian distributions ≠θσ I(0 ,) n2N , where θis the\\nmean vector deﬁ nes the value of fault and σ2is variance (known). The\\nfault is detected by deciding between:\\n=∼HX σ I{( 0 , ) } n 02N\\n=∼HX θ σ I{( , ) } n 12N\\nIn the GLRT, the unknown parameter θis estimated by maximizing\\nthe likelihood function. The generalized likelihood ratio is de ﬁned as:\\n===\\n∈λL\\nLsup f x\\nsup f x()\\n()θθθ\\nθθ0\\n1 Θ0\\n(11)\\nwhere L0is restricted maximum likelihood estimation of θand L1un-\\nrestricted maximum likelihood estimation. Therefore, ⩽⩽λ01 be-\\ncause⩽∈LL θ(Θ ). 01 0 The statistic λis called the test statistic in GLRT\\nand reject the null hypothesis H0for small values of λ.\\nEquivalently, using Wald’ s theorem, the statistic can be written as:\\n=− = −xl o g λ l l() 2 2 ( )10 L , where =⎛\\n⎝⎛\\n⎝⎞⎠ ⎞\\n⎠−∑= ll o g e\\nπσnx\\n01\\n2σin\\ni\\n21\\n2212and\\n=⎛\\n⎝⎛\\n⎝⎞⎠ ⎞\\n⎠−∑−= lelog\\nπσnxx\\n11\\n2()\\nσini\\n21\\n2212\\nwherexis the statistical mean of the\\nvariable x.\\nAfter simpli ﬁcation, the GLRT statistic can be computed as:\\n∑∑=⎛\\n⎝⎜−−⎞\\n⎠⎟\\n==xσxx x ()1\\n2()\\nin\\ni\\nin\\ni 2\\n12\\n12L\\n(12)\\nIn GLRT, the fault is detected by the decision between the hypoth-\\nesisH0andH1as:\\n=⎧\\n⎨⎩<δxHi f Lx hα\\nH else()() ()0\\n1 (13)\\nThe threshold h( α) is selected as:\\n⩾=Pxh α α(Δ( ) ( ))0 (14)\\nFig. 3.

Result and discussion\\nThis paper focuses on the thermocouple sensor fault detection in\\nFBTR. The FBTR has 175 thermocouples to measure the sodium tem-\\nperature, the details are given in section 2. The performance of theproposed method is validated by the real data of FBTR. A case study istaken in the isothermal condition of the process. In isothermal condi-\\ntion, all control rods are put down. Therefore, no reactions are hap-\\npening to generate the power. Some external heat is given to continue\\ntheﬂow of the sodium. In isothermal condition, all thermocouples\\nreading temperatures are approximately homogeneous and tempera-ture lies approximately in between 180 °C to 187 °C. In this case, the\\ntraining data contains 800 observations of 175 thermocouple sensors in\\nnormal conditions of the plant when all sensors (Thermocouples) are in\\nFig. 5.

The test data contains 200 observations of the same\\nnumber of sensors. In test data, a gradual fault is simulated on the 7th\\nsensors (TNA002X).\\nIn this work, the proposed ESVD-GLRT fault detection performance\\nis compared with PCA-GLRT and SVD-GLRT. Data reconstruction by the\\nPCA is depending upon the characteristics of the eigenvalues of the\\ncovariance matrix. If the eigenvalues are roughly equal, the re-\\nconstruction is not good, i.e. data does not map to the normal data. If\\ntheﬁrst eigenvalue is larger and remaining are very small, the re-\\nconstruction is good. In the case study data, the eigenvalues are roughlyequal, is presented in the Fig. 3 . Whereas the singular values of the data\\nare shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst singular value is larger and remaining are\\nvery small, so in the ﬁgure only ﬁrst singular is visible and others are\\nnegligible.The reconstruction generated by the PCA is not mapped to normal\\nbecause eigenvalues are roughly equal. But, Harrou et al. (2013) were\\ndeveloped a method for fault detection using PCA and GLRT. The GLRThas the ability to handle some reconstruction error. However, for a\\nlarge number of sensors, the PCA-GLRT may produce false alarms. The\\ndata reconstruction of fault free data using PCA, SVD and ESVD is\\nshown Figs. 5– 7. Similarly, for faulty data reconstruction using PCA,\\nSVD and ESVD is shown in Figs. 8 –10, where SVD, ESVD reconstruction\\nclearly shown the deviation of reconstructed from the original data.\\nFor a faulty test data reconstruction by traditional SVD method, the\\nfaulty data points of a sensor may a ﬀect the other fault free data points\\nof that sensor. The proposed ESVD mitigate this limitation. In ESVD, thetest data are reconstructed by the singular vector of the training data by\\nthe Eq. (6).

So, the residual generated by PCA and the residual which\\nwould be obtained by a model able to perfectly reconstruct the signalbehavior in normal conditions is di ﬀerent, is shown in the top left po-\\nsition of the Fig. 7. In the same ﬁgure at the top right is presented the\\nnormal signal and simulated gradual fault signal. Since the few faulty\\ndata points of faulty sensors a ﬀected the whole data points of that\\nsensor in traditional SVD reconstruction, so there is a small deviationbetween simulated error and SVD error, is shown in the bottom left of\\nFig. 7. But, ESVD is a robust reconstruction method, so the simulated\\nerror and ESVD reconstruction error has approximately coincided in the\\nFig. 7 bottom right position.\\nThe fault detection performance of PCA-GLRT, SVD-GLRT and\\nESVD-GLRT are presented from Figs. 8– 13. For a fault free data, the\\nGLRT decision function produces some false alarms for PCAreconstruction, because there may be problematic in data reconstruc-\\ntion, is shown in Fig. 8. The SVD-GLRT and ESVD-GLRT are not pro-\\nducing any false alarm for fault free test, are depicted in Figs. 9 and 10.\\nConsequently, for faulty test data, PCA-GLRT detected an actual fault\\nwith some false alarms is shown in Fig. 11 . Since, SVD data re-\\nconstruction has been a ﬀected by faulty data points, so they may pro-\\nduce false alarms only that sensor with actual fault, is shown in Fig. 12.\\nThe robust reconstruction method ESVD with the help of GLRT, cor-rectly ﬁnd out the fault region of the data, is presented in Fig. 12.\\nFinally the analysis of detection using PCA-GLRT, SVD-GLRT, and\\nESVD-GLRT is given in Fig. 14 . It is analyzed that the PCA-GLRT based\\nmethod produces more false alarms than SVD-GLRT and ESVD-GLRT.The ESVD-GLRT is an e ﬃcient method for sensor fault detection in\\nNuclear Power Plants.\\n5. Conclusions\\nOnline monitoring of the sensor physical condition can avoid many\\nproblems associated with manual calibration of the sensors. The SVD\\nbased model is developed for detection the sensor fault in Nuclear\\nPower Plants. This paper addresses an enhanced SVD (ESVD) re-\\nconstruction method, which is superior to SVD reconstruction. It is a\\nsimple linear algebraic factorization method. The ESVD is used to\\ngenerate the residual matrix by selecting few singular vectors corre-\\nsponding to largest singular values. The reconstruction matrix is\\nmapped to the normal data. The GLRT is employed in residual space to\\ndetect the faulty sensor. If the GLRT decision function crosses the\\nthreshold value, then the fault is detected. The ESVD-GLRT based fault\\ndetection method is better than PCA-GLRT and SVD-GLRT. For fault\\nfree data, the PCA-GLRT also may produce false alarms due to data\\nreconstruction problem. The SVD-GLRT is better than PCA-GLRT, but\\nthey didn ’tﬁnd out the actual fault starting point due to the fault-free\\ndata points of a signal are a ﬀected by the faulty data points. In a dy-\\nnamic process, it is very ﬂexible to update the model and satisfactorily\\nprovide the result. The performance of the proposed method is vali-\\ndated by the real data of FBTR. Its time complexity is also very less\\ncompared to other machine learning techniques. This paper addresses\\nonly thermocouple sensor detection. In future work, we want to extend\\nto others sensor fault detection and analysis the fault in FBTR.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis research work is ﬁnancially supported by the Board of Research\\nin Nuclear Science (BRNS), India, under the research project bearing\\nthe number: 2013/36/42-BRNS/2502 and Council of\\nScienti ﬁc & Industrial Research (CSIR), India, under grant number 09/\\n1095/0018/2016-EMR-1.
